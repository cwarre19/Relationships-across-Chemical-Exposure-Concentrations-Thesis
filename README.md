# Relationships-across-Chemical-Exposure-Concentrations-Thesis
Using laboratory data from NHANES CDC site, we will join different chemical exposure related records to one larger database of multiple datasets available on the website. We will then attempt to accurately impute values in columns that are missing, i.e. calculate one missing chemical exposure concentration using models based on available data on other factors and exposure concentrations. We then will test our approach on out of sample time periods to validate its effectiveness and accuracy. The overall goal is to see if we can infer unreported chemical exposure levels using available data from the NHANES public database.
